Date Handling in Tests:
Always use explicit dates in tests rather than relying on current time
Mock dates consistently across test cases
Keep date mocking simple - avoid complex date manipulation in mocks
Animation Style Testing:
Focus on testing the mapping between holidays and their expected animation styles
Keep holiday mocks simple - use isHolidayActive to return true rather than complex date logic
Ensure each holiday test case has clear, documented expectations
Test Organization:
Keep test cases focused and isolated
Clean up mocks after each test
Use descriptive test names that reflect the specific behavior being tested
update the readme file with new features developed
update admin.md file with how to use the new features and ai agents created
please review the documentation starting with the PROJECT_DOCUMENTION_GUIDE.md file to ensure we are aligned with the goals and objectives and the ROADMAP.md file for updates
always ask questions when performing updates to ensure staying aligned with the goals and objectives
