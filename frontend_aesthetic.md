Based on the trends in modern makeup and fashion websites, here are my recommendations for your directory's frontend design:

## Color Scheme

For a modern, slick, and couture look, I recommend a sophisticated color palette with the following colors:

- Deep forest green: #283635
- Light beige: #f4efeb
- Almost black: #121e26
- Coral accent: #f27457

This color scheme combines elegance with a touch of vibrancy, perfect for a high-end makeup directory. The deep green and almost black provide a luxurious base, while the light beige offers contrast and the coral adds a pop of color that's reminiscent of makeup tones.

## Typography

For typography, I suggest using a combination of two fonts:

1. A sleek, modern sans-serif font for headings and navigation, such as Montserrat or Futura.
2. A slightly more decorative, yet readable font for body text, like Didot or Playfair Display.

This combination will create a sophisticated and fashion-forward look that aligns with couture aesthetics.

## Background Images and Videos

To showcase the makeup and fashion focus of your directory, consider featuring:

1. Close-up videos of makeup application techniques, such as eyeshadow blending or lipstick application.
2. High-quality images of diverse models wearing various makeup looks.
3. Slow-motion footage of makeup products being swatched or applied.

These visuals will immediately convey the purpose of your directory and engage visitors.

## Interactions and Animations

To create a smooth and engaging user experience, consider incorporating:

1. Parallax scrolling effects for background images or videos.
2. Subtle hover animations on directory listings, such as a slight zoom or color change.
3. Smooth transitions between pages or sections using fade effects or slide animations.
4. A dynamic grid layout for directory listings that smoothly rearranges as users apply filters.
5. Animated loading of images and content as users scroll down the page.

These interactions will add a modern, high-end feel to your directory while keeping the user experience smooth and intuitive.
